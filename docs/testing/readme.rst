Reactor Testing
###############

The **Testing** section provides a comprehensive guide to ensuring the stability, reliability, and performance of **reactor** in your Kubernetes environments. Whether you are testing core features, extensions, or entire cluster projects, this section outlines the best practices for validating your deployments before they reach production. The **test architecture** subsection introduces the foundational structure for testing within **reactor**, covering the tools and methodologies used to create a robust testing framework.

In the **core testing** subsection, you’ll find guidelines for testing the platform’s fundamental components, ensuring that critical functionalities operate as expected. The **extension testing** subsection focuses on how to validate custom modules and extensions, providing insight into maintaining modularity without sacrificing stability. Lastly, the **cluster project testing** subsection covers end-to-end testing for entire Kubernetes clusters and projects, ensuring that your infrastructure and applications perform consistently under various conditions.

By following the practices laid out in this section, you will ensure that your use of **reactor** is thoroughly tested at every level, helping to mitigate issues early and maintain high-quality, production-ready deployments.
