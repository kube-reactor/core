Reactor Core Concepts
#####################

The **Core Concepts** section provides a foundational understanding of the principles and architecture behind **reactor**, enabling you to make the most of its capabilities in Kubernetes environments. This section explores how the platform’s design emphasizes **modularity and extensibility**, allowing you to tailor features to your specific needs and extend its functionality with custom modules. By leveraging **Kubernetes integration**, **reactor** enhances the native capabilities of Kubernetes, making it easier to manage clusters and applications through a unified command interface.

You'll also find an in-depth explanation of the platform’s **CLI structure**, which organizes commands in an intuitive hierarchy for interacting with Kubernetes resources efficiently. The **project structure** subsection details how projects and workloads are organized within the platform, providing clarity on best practices for maintaining scalable and maintainable environments. Finally, the **key terminology** subsection defines essential terms that are frequently used in the documentation, ensuring you understand the core concepts of both **reactor** and Kubernetes.

By the end of this section, you will have a solid grasp of the platform’s architecture and how it enhances your Kubernetes development and management workflows, equipping you to use **reactor** effectively in real-world scenarios.
