The **Community and Support** section connects you with the resources you need to get help, contribute to the development of **reactor**, and engage with the broader user community. Whether you’re troubleshooting an issue or looking to contribute to the platform’s evolution, this section provides the essential links and guidelines to make the most of the community-driven ecosystem. In the **support links** subsection, you'll find direct access to forums, chat channels, and official documentation, where you can ask questions, share experiences, and learn from other users.

If you encounter bugs or need assistance with specific issues, the **filing issues** subsection offers detailed instructions on how to report problems effectively, ensuring that the development team can address your concerns promptly. For those interested in contributing code, writing documentation, or sharing ideas, the **contributing** subsection provides guidelines on how to get involved with the project and participate in its growth. Additionally, the **paid support** subsection outlines premium support options for users or organizations needing dedicated assistance beyond the community channels.
